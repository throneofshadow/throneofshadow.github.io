    summary: Real-time ETL pipeline for custom high-dimensional time-series data and SQL stream.
    description:  ETL pipeline for 3-D CNN keypoint predictions, relational data. Performs each pre-processing step using
                  CLI interface. Pre-processing steps include 2-D video keypoint prediction using pre-trained neural network, 
                  2D to 3D keypoint translation using Direct Linear Transformation, and warehousing keypoint and neurophysiology data
                  for SQL-type queries using Mongo. Performs real-time ETL, given networked inputs.
